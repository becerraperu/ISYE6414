**(a) Test for the significance of each variable as it enters the model. For each of the three responses state the test:  the null hypothesis in terms of the regression coefficient parameters, the value of the test statistic and the p-value of the statistic.**

$n=22$

$SS_{X_{1}} = 981.326$

$SS_{X_{2}|X_{1}} = 190.232$

$SS_{X_{3}|X_{2},X_{1}} = 190.232$

$SS_{full} =SS_{X_{1}}+SS_{X_{2}|X_{1}}+SS_{X_{3}|X_{2},X_{1}}=981.326+190.232+129.431=1300.989$

$MSE_{full}=\dfrac{SS_{full}}{n}=59.136$

#$F_{partial}=\frac{\frac{RSS_{Reduced}-RSS_{Full}}{\delta\#predictors(full-reduced)}}{\frac{RSS_{Full}}{n-k}}=$

1. when $X_{1}$ enters the model. $F_{X_{1}}=\dfrac{SS_{X_{1}}}{MSE_{X_{1}}}=22$
